## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- First using a new operating system, always been a Windows person but wanted to learn iOS programming which was not possible without using macOS.
- Learning a new language. Swift is very new to me I have experience in Java, C++, Python so learning a little bit of Swift was super fun.
- Learning xCode and all the new changes Apple has brought to it in the past few months. Had to figure out all the new challenges that comes with learning to use a new IDE.
